# What is it?

MRIQC extracts no-reference IQMs (image quality metrics) from structural (T1w and T2w), functional and diffusion MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) data.

Basically it can help you determine the quality of some MRI images (which can be helpful for very large datasets).

The best way to learn about MRIQC is to read their [documentation](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

# Installation 

Can be run as a docker (see below), or on its own (local install).

## Local install
```bash
pip install mriqc
```

### Upgrade 

```bash
pip install --user --upgrade mriqc
```

## Docker install or upgrade

```bash
docker pull nipreps/mriqc:latest
```

# User Guide 

[mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker.html](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docker.html)

Example with docker for participant level (for help with docker, see [our docker page](../tutorials/docker.qmd))

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/data:ro \
-v $PWD/derivatives/mriqc:/out \
nipreps/mriqc:latest /data /out \
participant --participant_label <subject-id>
```

Group level (after you have run MRIQC on all participants):

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/data:ro \
-v $PWD/derivatives/mriqc:/out \
nipreps/mriqc:latest /data /out group
```
