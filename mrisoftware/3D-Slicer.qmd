# Introduction

3D Slicer is a free, open source software for visualization, processing,
segmentation, registration, and analysis of medical, biomedical, and
other 3D images and meshes; and planning and navigating image-guided
procedures.


# Download and Install

3D Slicer is available for Windows, Mac and Linux

[download.slicer.org/](https://download.slicer.org/)

You will likely want the 'Stable Release'

![](img/download3dslicer.png)

After downloading, install using your usual operating system method.

You may have to read and agree to their terms and conditions.

# Tutorial

Now that 3D Slicer is installed, open it how you would usually open applications on your operating system.

This is how it looks when I first load it up [Note: it may look different on your computer depending on if a newer version has been released]

## Loading Nifti Files 

Many medical imaging files come in what's called the 'NIfTI' format (stands for Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative). These files will end in either `.nii` or a compressed version `.nii.gz`

To load a `.nii` or `.nii.gz` file:

File \> Add Data \> Choose File(s) to Add

Now you should be able to view three different 'slices' of your brain:

Using your mouse, hover over the view you want to interact with, and use your scroll wheel to navigate through slices. Or hold down CTRL while using the scroll wheel to zoom in.

To move the image around (in case you want to zoom into a particular area), hold down your scroll-wheel and move your cursor.

## 3D Rendering 

Would you like to see your brain in 3D and perform a 'virtual dissection'?

- Click on the \"Welcome to Slicer\" drop down menu (Top left)
- Click on \"Volume Rendering\"
- Click on the \'closed eye\' in the top left (beside the name of the
image)
- You can then do a digital dissection by clicking on Crop: Enable;
Display ROI, then click on the green, red, blue whatever circles to move
the planes to dissect

Here is a gif that shows these steps in detail [Note: if the image is too small, right-click, and press 'Open Image in New Tab']
